      <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold mb-6 text-primary-foreground">About Me</h1>
      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
        Hi, I'm Mohd Altaf — a passionate MERN Stack Developer and the founder of <span className="text-primary-foreground font-semibold">Adowise.com</span>, a platform dedicated to connecting individuals with verified experts for 1:1 mentorship and career services. I specialize in building full-stack applications using MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js, and I’m deeply focused on creating user-centric, scalable digital solutions.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
        My journey into tech started from a simple curiosity about how websites function. That curiosity soon turned into a deep passion for web development. Over the years, I’ve explored the full development cycle—from creating intuitive frontends with React to designing secure backend systems with Node.js and Express. I'm particularly interested in building platforms that solve real-world problems, offer value, and improve user experiences.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
        I founded <span className="text-primary-foreground font-semibold">Adowise</span> to address a growing gap in the mentorship and consultation space. With Adowise, users can find the right experts for their needs, book real-time consultations, send priority messages, and access services like resume reviews and mock interviews—all through one unified platform. It’s not just a tech product—it's a mission to empower others through access to knowledge and experience.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
        Beyond Adowise, I’m constantly working on side projects that challenge me to grow as a developer. Whether it’s building robust authentication systems, experimenting with AI-powered assistants, or designing dynamic dashboards, I enjoy learning by doing. I also spend a good amount of time reading documentation, exploring new tools, and improving my design thinking to better structure the products I build.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
        I believe in clean code, consistent UI/UX, and building things that matter. I’m also actively interested in automation, affiliate marketing, and emerging technologies like AI and blockchain. My long-term goal is to become a full-stack tech entrepreneur, creating tools that help people live smarter and work better.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg">
        When I’m not coding, you’ll likely find me researching new tech trends, creating comedic concepts (like my animated character “Pappe”), or spending time with my family in Himachal Pradesh. I also love connecting with other developers, whether it's to share knowledge, collaborate, or just geek out over new libraries and frameworks.
