      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
        Hi, I'm Mohd Altaf — a passionate web developer with a Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA). I enjoy building modern, responsive websites and applications using technologies like React, Node.js, and the MERN stack.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
        My journey in tech started with a curiosity for how websites work, and since then, I've been continuously learning and improving my skills. I love solving real-world problems through code and exploring new tools and frameworks.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
        Apart from coding, I'm also interested in graphic design and often take part in creative competitions. I’m currently diving deeper into full-stack development and working on side projects that challenge and inspire me.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg">
        When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me reading tech blogs, learning something new, or sharing knowledge with the developer community through my startup.
      </p>
    </div>
